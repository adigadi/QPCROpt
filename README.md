# QPCROpt
### Objectives
This project aims to use active learning algorithm and Thermo Fisher's integrated robotics system to fully automate optimization of qPCR parameters, such as GC content of the primers, amplification length, etc., evaluated on the basis of Ct values. A lower Ct value signifies a more efficient qPCR. The active learning algorithm and data analysis were written in Python. The liquid handling script was put together using CyBio Scripting for operating the CyBio Felix liquid handler. qPCR was carried out using QuantStudio 7, plate transfer was done by the Spinnaker robotic arm, and scheduling was implemented using the Momentum software.
