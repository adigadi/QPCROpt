### Objectives
This project aims to use active learning algorithm and Thermo Fisher's integrated robotics system to fully automate optimization of qPCR parameters, such as GC content of the primers, amplification length, etc., evaluated on the basis of Ct values. A lower Ct value signifies a more efficient qPCR./
